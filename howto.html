  <div class="mb-2 pl-4">
    <div class="">
      <a class="underline text-sky-300" target="_blank" href="/">The coverage map</a>
      is a crowd-sourced visualization of repeater coverage in the PNW MeshCore mesh.
    </div>

    <div class="">
      The map has a few features.
      <ul class="pl-4 text-sm list-disc">
        <li>Green dot - the mesh was reachable at that location.</li>
        <li>Red dot - the mesh was not reachable at that location.</li>
        <li>Dashed line - links a green dot to its 1st hop repeater.</li>
        <li>Blue dot - repeater with an advert in the past 1 day.</li>
        <li>Light gray dot - repeater with an advert in the past 5 days.</li>
        <li>Dark gray dot - repeater without an advery in the past 5 days.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </div>

  <h2 class="mb-2 text-xl text-slate-100">How it works</h2>
  <div class="mb-2 pl-4 text-base">
    You send your location to #wardrive in the format "lat.xxxx lon.yyyy". If the bot receives your location, a
    new point is added to the map indicating you can reach the mesh at that spot.
    If you want to also log places where you can't reach the mesh, there's a
    helpful web app you can run on your phone to automate the process.
    Currently, you have to be heard by 'Devils Lake Repeater [2b]', but the
    goal is to migrate to using MQTT for more reliable detection.

  <h2 class="mb-2 text-xl text-slate-100">How you can contribute</h2>
  <div class="mb-2 pl-4 text-base">
    The easiest way to contribute is to use the
    <a class="underline text-sky-300" target="_blank" href="/wardrive">Wardrive app</a>.
    It allows you to connect to your companion radio and send ping messages
    automatically. It also sends your ping location to the service so that
    misses are also automatically logged. You can send single pings or enable
    'auto mode' which will send a ping on an interval as long as you've moved
    the minimum distance since your last ping.
  </div>

  <h3 class="mb-2 pl-4 text-lg text-slate-100">Using the Wardrive app</h3>
  <div class="mb-2 pl-4 text-base">
    It mostly "just works", but there are few things to know when using the app.
    <ul class="mb-2 pl-4 text-sm list-disc">
      <li>You must allow access to Bluetooth and Location in your browser.</li>
      <li>Your companion radio must add the #wardrive channel. The app will help with that.</li>
      <li>It does not work in Safari.
        <ul class="pl-4 text-sm list-disc">
          <li>On Macos, use Edge or Chrome.</li>
          <li>On iOS, use the <a class="underline text-sky-300" target="_blank"
              href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/bluefy-web-ble-browser/id1492822055">Bluefy app</a></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>You have to disconnect from the MeshCore app in order to connect to your radio. BLE only allows one
        connection.</li>
      <li>If you're using auto mode, the web page must be in the foreground and the screen unlocked.
        <ul class="pl-4 text-sm list-disc">
          <li>It tries to keep the screen alive while running, but I've only tested on iOS.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Don't spam the mesh or the service. The mesh is a shared resource -- be judicious.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <h2 class="mb-2 text-xl text-slate-100">Privacy</h2>
  <div class="pl-4 text-base">
    The only thing the service stores is the location you send to #wardrive and the id of the 1st hop repeater.
    The web app sends your location to #wardrive and to the service. That's it. Logging on the web app is stored
    locally.
    You will be sending your companion radio's name with your location to #wardrive which is a public channel.
